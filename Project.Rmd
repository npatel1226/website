##Introduction

I chose the datasets "lung" and "Melanoma" becuase I thought it would be interesting to compare the data of 2 different types of cancers. Melanoma contained variables like tumor thickness and presence/ansence of ulcers, while lung contained variables like ECOG and Karnofsky performance scores and weight loss. However the variables I was interested in were the following numerical variables-age (of patient), time (survival time), and status (dead or alive). I wanted to see the relationship age would have on the survival rates. I expect to see a relationship in which less survival rates as age increases. 

#Tidying and Joining

```{r}
data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
library(dplyr)
library("devtools")
library("pipeR")
library("tidyverse")
library("tidyr")
library(survival)
data(lung)
library(MASS)
data("Melanoma")
Melanoma %>% pivot_wider(names_from="status", values_from="age")
melanomauntidy <-Melanoma %>% pivot_wider(names_from="status", values_from="age")
melanomauntidy %>% pivot_longer(c("3", "2", "1"), names_to="status", values_to="age")
melanomatidy <-melanomauntidy %>% pivot_longer(c("3", "2", "1"), names_to="status", values_to="age")
lung %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "status", values_from = "age")
lunguntidy <-lung %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "status", values_from = "age")
lunguntidy %>% pivot_longer(c("2", "1"), names_to="status", values_to="age")
lungtidy <-lunguntidy %>% pivot_longer(c("2", "1"), names_to="status", values_to="age")
Melanoma %>% right_join (lung)
cancer <- right_join(Melanoma, lung)
cancer %>% na.omit(cancer)

```

Both of the datasets were already tidy so I had to untidy them first. I used pivot_wider in order to do this so all of the variables had their own columns. I used pivot_longer to re-tidy. I used full join in order to join both datasets so all of the original dataset would be retained and no rows would be dropped. I thought that since I wasn't comparing many variables, I should keep as much as original of the data as possible. 

#Wrangling

```{r}

glimpse(cancer %>% filter(status == "1", sex == "0"))
glimpse(cancer %>% filter(status == "1", sex == "1"))
glimpse(cancer %>% filter(status == "2", sex == "0"))
glimpse(cancer %>% filter(status == "2", sex == "1"))
glimpse(cancer %>% filter(status == "3", sex == "0"))
glimpse(cancer %>% filter(status == "1", sex == "1"))
glimpse(cancer %>% slice(1,n()))
glimpse(cancer %>% dplyr::select(1,2,4))
glimpse(cancer %>% arrange(desc(status),desc(age), desc(sex), desc(time)))
glimpse(cancer %>% mutate(survivaltime=time/365))
glimpse(cancer %>% mutate(meanage=mean(age)))
glimpse(cancer %>% summarize(mean(age,na.rm = T), n(), n_distinct(status)))
glimpse(cancer %>% summarize(mean(age,na.rm = T), n(), n_distinct(time)))
cancer %>% group_by(status) %>% summarize(meanage=mean(age, na.rm = T), sdage=sd(age,na.rm = T), varage=var(age,na.rm=T),meantime=mean(time,na.rm=T),sdtime=sd(time,na.rm=T),vartime=var(time,na.rm=T),meanthickness=mean(thickness, na.rm = T), sdsthickness=sd(thickness,na.rm = T), varthickness=var(thickness,na.rm=T),meanphecog=mean(ph.ecog, na.rm=T), sdsphecog=sd(ph.ecog, na.rm = T), varphecog=var(ph.ecog,na.rm = T))

```

With the fitler and slice function, I was able to choose specific rows I wanted to see based on status of the patient and their sex. Select function allowed me to choose specific variables to observe. After arranging, I see the information such as age and time of survival of patients who are alive and dead. The oldest censored patient survived 31 days while the youngest censored patient survived 5 days. I created a new variable which converted survial time into years and the mean of the ages. Summarizing shows that the mean age was 62.44 distint upon censored status and 186 days for survial time. A dead patient was on average age 60 years while a censored patient was on average 63 years old. 

#Visualizing 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cancer,aes(x=age,y=time,fill=status))+geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun.y="mean", position = "dodge")+ggtitle("Survival Time by Age")+theme(legend.position = "none")
ggplot(cancer,aes(status))+geom_bar(aes(fill=age))+theme(legend.position = "none")+ggtitle("Status based on Age")

```


The first plot shows the ages based on the survial time in days. I do not see a distinct correlation between the 2 variables since the days differ from eaach other for all ages. Most of the alive and censored patients however are young, which was expected. They range from ages 38-50 years old. 
The second plot shows the count distribution for each status. There was a signficantly greater number of alive patients than dead patients. 

#Dimensionality Reduction

```{r}
cancer1<-cancer%>%dplyr::select(status, age, time)       
cancer1%>%select_if(is.numeric)%>%scale
cancer_nums<-cancer1%>%select_if(is.numeric)%>%scale
rownames(cancer_nums)<-cancer$time       
cancer_pca<-princomp((cancer_nums),cor = TRUE, scores = TRUE)
names(cancer_pca)
summary(cancer_pca, loadings = T)
eigval<-cancer_pca$sdev^2
varprop=round(eigval/sum(eigval),2)
ggplot()+geom_bar(aes(y=varprop,x=1:3),stat="identity")+xlab("")+geom_path(aes(y=varprop,x=1:3))+geom_text(aes(x=1:3,y=varprop,label=round(varprop,2)),vjust=1,col="white",size=5)+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,.6,.2),labels = scales::percent)+scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:10)
round(cumsum(eigval)/sum(eigval),2)
eigval
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(cancer_pca$scores[,1], cancer_pca$scores[,2]))+xlab("PC1")+ylab("PC2")
cancer_pca$loadings[1:3,1:2]%>%as.data.frame%>%rownames_to_column%>%
  ggplot()+geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0),lty=2)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=0),lty=2)+ylab("PC2")+xlab("PC1")+
  geom_segment(aes(x=0,y=0,xend=Comp.1,yend=Comp.2),arrow=arrow(),col="red")+
  geom_label(aes(x=Comp.1*1.1,y=Comp.2*1.1,label=rowname))

```


The first graph shows that there is no correlation between PC1 and PC2. Most of the data was concentrated on the negative side, but there is no distinct relationship. The second graph shows that there is no correlation between teh 3 variables-age, status, and time. This proves my earlier expectation of having a negative correlation between age and status inccorect, becuase this graph proves otherwise. 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
